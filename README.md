# Productivity App
Cornell CS 3110 Final Project: OCaml-based Productivity App

## Features
Terminal-based productivity app for users to manage and track their tasks/goals. User-input is parsed using NLP so key task components can be extracted and mapped to local database. Tasks, dates, and user-preferences are persistent and stored in JSON files. Front-end utilizes ASCII arts to display tasks, deadlines, and window in an appealling way.
